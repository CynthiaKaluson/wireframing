# Wireframing: From Blueprint to Prototype

## 0. Introduction to Wireframing
**Wireframing** is a simple visual outline (a “blueprint”) of a website or app. It shows the **structure, layout, and basic functionality** without worrying about colors, fonts, or final images. Because wireframes are low on visual detail, teams can focus on **how the product works** and whether the **user experience** makes sense.

**Why wireframing matters:**
- **Aligns the team early:** everyone sees the same structure and flow.
- **Finds issues sooner:** it’s cheaper to fix a layout on a wireframe than in code.
- **Saves time later:** fewer redesigns once development starts.
- **Improves communication:** designers, developers, and stakeholders talk using the same “blueprint.”
